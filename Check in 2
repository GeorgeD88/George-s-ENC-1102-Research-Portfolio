1. My research question is basically: What is the impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on creative careers?

NLP is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate very accurate text or process text and truly understand it like a human. A popular example is Dall-E 2, the AI that everyone's been using to make interesting pics. Dall-E uses NLP to very accurately understand the prompts you give it, and generate an image based on its understanding of your prompt. This poses the interesting question, what's gonna happen to people whose jobs it is to make images, or to make text like marketing.

        A. I think some interviews with other people in computer science would be beneficial, to see their prediction. Maybe even talking to people on the other side, like people in these creative careers that my paper is about. I also think observation is useful, because NLP is still new and we're still waiting to see these effects that we're anticipating. So observing how NLP will start being used and looking out for it being implemented in marketing will be important information.

        B. I would talk to my cousin who is a software engineer at Indeed, and talk to a friend who's working on his own company that's based on making an AI product.

        C. N/A

        D. I think observation would especially work because that's a direct example answer to my research question. If I could watch how NLP grows into different industries, then that's exactly what I need to answer my question. And I chose these participants because I feel like they know a lot about this field and I think they have enough expertise that their personal prediction of how this will play out will be important information for my research.

3. I would be a bit worried about if I'm getting the best information I can, or if it's not the most fruitful data. But overall, I think it will turn out good.
