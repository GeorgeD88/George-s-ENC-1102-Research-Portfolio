# WRITE & DISCUSS: Check-In #1

To complete Check-In #1, answer the following questions in at least 200 words and no more than 400 words:

1. What is the topic you are proposing?
2. Why are you interested in this topic?
3. How will you connect this topic to writing, rhetoric, reading, literacy, or communication? / How is your topic appropriate for a writing and rhetoric class?
4. What would doing this research allow you to better understand about the topic?
5. Why might studying this topic be important?

**My response:**
1. The impact on AI/NLP on jobs in the arts or writing

2. As a CS major, I'm interested in pursuing AI and I'm actively interested in its progression.

3. NLP is an AI that stands for Natural Language Processing, meaning it involves lots of text. Some concerns with it, is that it can produce content instead of relying on humans. For example, someone had the AI write a research paper on the development of that AI itself, removing the need for the researchers.

4. A lot of people talk about will AI steal our jobs or take jobs of creative work such as art or producing articles, but a lot of the talk is based on opinions and the conclusions are pretty arbitrary. I'm hoping that with researching, I can understand more about this topic so that I could have a more concrete answer.

5. It's important because AI is a rapidly growing field and constantly learning TONS about it, so studying this topic is part of furthering our understanding of AI.
