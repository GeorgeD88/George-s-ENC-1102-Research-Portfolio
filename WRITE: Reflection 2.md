Part 1

I had trouble with starting task 1 at first, just because of my own struggle to start assignments and feeling overwhelmed with where to start, even though it was just as simple as searching my question. Once I finally started searching, I was able to come across more and more resources somewhat easily.

For my successes, firstly was coming up with my question at all, because I always struggle with thinking of an initial idea. Once I thought of my question, the next big success was that it was such a fruitful question since this is something that's currently very relevant and a problem/question we are currently living, so it was perfect.

Part 2

I think my progress has definitely helped towards contributing knowledge. I'm coming across more and more resources, and reading and it's helping me develop my own opinion on this topic. Like I had said earlier, this is a very current question/topic that we're living, so me developing my own opinion to provide is an important way to contribute knowledge. This is also important as someone in computer science and also wanting to specialize in artificial intelligence, so this will influence how I work and what I do. I will also help generate inquiry, as my topic will spark more debate from others like readers and such. It becomes a giant discussion and generates lots more ideas.
