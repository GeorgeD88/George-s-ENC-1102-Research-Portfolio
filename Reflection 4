Part 1

My writing process was very slow, especially in the beginning. I wouldn't say I discovered anything new about the way I write, it's more or less been the same for a while. The paper was a lot more overwhelming for me in the beginning, which made it a lot harder for me to get through or even start. Once I finally pushed myself through that initial block, I feel like it got easier and easier as I started coming up with more ideas of things to say. One of my biggest successes was in the interview research. I feel like I learned so much from the interview, even when I thought I understand a lot about computer science. It was a fun interview with lots of great information. Next time, I'll do everything I can to get myself through the initial wordblock and get the ideas flowing.



Part 2

I definitely think this paper helped me with generating inquiry and exploring curious ideas further.
This helped me with integrating different forms of writing, for example getting research through online sources but then also interviewing.
There are some specific moments where I analyzed my sources for credibility and how important their info is.
I don't completely understand this point, so I'm not sure if I achieved it.
100% achieved this, as I drew many conclusions and thoughts from the work I analyzed.
This class helped a lot with this, with the constant discussions and group revisions.
